**`(SRE / DevSecOps / Infrastructure Architect)`**

---

### ## /etc/motd
* **Uptime:** 10+ Years Professional Lifecycle (8 years focused on DevOps/SRE/FinOps).
* **Location:** Tokyo, Japan (Currently Migrating to PR Instance 🇯🇵).
* **Mission:** Building resilient, "Default Deny" architectures for high-frequency data and blockchain systems.
* **Impact:** Mentored 50+ students in Cloud, AI, and Technical Skills.

---

### ## [SECURITY_GROUP: DEFENSE_&_ADVERSARIAL_INTEL]
> **Adversarial Mindset:** I build by thinking like an attacker to defend like an architect.

#### **Intrusion Defense & Security Orchestration**
* **Active Defense:** Tuning **Suricata** and **Snort** (IDS/IPS) for real-time traffic analysis and automated threat blocking.
* **Secret Governance:** Hardening **HashiCorp Vault Enterprise** (AppRole/TLS) to eliminate "Secret Zero" vulnerabilities.
* **Identity Management:** Implementing **Cloudflare Access** Zero Trust tunnels to replace traditional VPNs, enforcing MFA and strict device posture.

#### **Threat Modeling & Mitigation**
* **Reconnaissance Countermeasures:** Designing infrastructure to minimize public attack surfaces via DNS obfuscation and port knocking.
* **Lateral Movement Prevention:** Engineering strict **Kubernetes Network Policies** and micro-segmentation to isolate potential compromises.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Integrating **Trivy** and **Snyk** into CI/CD pipelines for automated dependency and container scanning.
